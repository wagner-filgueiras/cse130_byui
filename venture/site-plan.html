        This web site features my work in re designing the concept for this mobile app called The Venture App. 
This User Interface was primarily developed during the User Interface Design and Development class at Brigham Young University - Idaho. 

Mobile App Objetive
The objective of this App is to present a solution for users looking for outdoor activities information nearby. Applying design and usability principles <br/>
I made key changes on the overall App interface appearance. By doing that I was able to design a more fluid, intuitive and user-friendly application.<br/>
Which allows the user to easily interact and engage with the App.<br/><br/>

Through the design process, one of the mais decisions was to divide the app in sections as Header, Body, Lower and Navigation. <br/>
Having in mind that doing so, this would facilitate the development of future new features and elements on the interface. <br/>
This also helps to harmonize the interface design and creates a more easy to learn curve for the users.

        When a location pin is tapped, the screen will display a card scroller menu with options inside that Pin screen. <br/>
        Overlaying all the other pins while the screen got a gray color background behind the cards. This would help the user to clearly see a prompt<br/>
        feedback about the interaction made and amplify the range of options and next steps the user could take from that point. Expanding the amount of <br/>
        information available for the user within few steps of interaction.
