    <h2>More Than Just Another Outdoor Adventure App</h2>
        <p>The objective of this App is to present a solution for users looking for outdoor activities information nearby. 
            Applying design and usability principles I made key changes on the overall App interface appearance. By doing that I was able to design a more fluid, 
            intuitive and user-friendly application. Which allows the user to easily interact and engage with the App.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Through the design process, one of the mais decisions was to divide the app in sections as Header, Body, Lower and Navigation. Having in mind that doing so, this would facilitate the development of future new features and elements on the interface. This also helps to harmonize the interface design and creates a more easy to learn curve for the users.
